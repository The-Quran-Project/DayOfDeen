# DayOfDeen
An open source multi-platform app for every day Prayer time and beyond. No ads, ever!


## Why?

I had been using **Muslim Day** app since 2020. I always admired it for having no ads and providing this for the Ummah.

But recently, they collaborated with [Kahf](https://kahf.com.tr/) and the whole app became a *piece of shit* ( yes, I said it )
<br><br>
Unnecessary junks, useless features, unskipable ads. I'm very, very, very disappointed. Their goal was once to `"Never show ads"`.
Now they show, `Halal Ads`.

But at the end of the day, `ADS are ADS` that's it.
<br><br><br><br>
So here I am, promising to you all, if I stay alive, and able to code, I will definitely make a simpler, ad free, open-source alternative to all the other Prayer Time app, **InShaAllah**.

> I would start right away, but I have some very important exams coming soon. Those will change the course of my life. Therefore, I can't start it right now.
> But, here's the repo. And I will come back, InShaAllah.
