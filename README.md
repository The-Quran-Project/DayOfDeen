# ⛔ Still in Development, Not ready yet

# DayOfDeen
An open source multi-platform app for every day Prayer time and beyond. No ads, ever!


## Why?

I've been using **Muslim Day** app since 2020. I always admired it for having no ads and providing this for the Ummah.

But after recent updates, the app is full of unnecessary junks, useless features and unskipable ads. Their goal was once to `"Never show ads"`.
<br>
They don't show *unacceptable* ads like others. That's a good thing.
But at the end of the day, `ADS are ADS` that's it.
<br>

However, compared to others, they are *indeed* doing a better job at it. **_"Compared to others"_**

Other similar apps like, `WeMuslim`, `নামাজের সময়সূচী`, `Muslim Pro` shows totally unacceptable ads. And literally forces you to _"Pay a subscription fee"_.

Before we make a stable version of `Day of Deen` app, you should use **Muslim Day**. After we're finished, you can decide which one you prefer. (`I'm gonna prefer mine, of course. Cuz I made it!`)

<br><br><br><br>
So if I stay alive, I will definitely make a simpler, ad free, open-source alternative to all the other Prayer Time app, **InShaAllah**.
